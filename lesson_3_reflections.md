If you want to store your work in a safe place, a remote repository located on
a server that is tailored to storing them securely and redundantly will help to
mitigate issues involving data loss on your local machine (i.e. your computer
and/or hard drive dying).

Working collaboratively with others is also much easier with a remote
repository. Local repositories on each developer's machine can interact with
the remote repository, which will act as a de facto master copy.
